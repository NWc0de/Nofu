# nofu README

This is a WIP related to a personal project - https://medium.com/@nwcodex/ingesting-machine-language-9847156fe0fc.

TODO - 

1. Solve the problem of struct definition identification (right now identification is limited to a few structured type definitions)
2. Add support for enum definiti`on


What it does:

Lintsc|cc|h|cpp files in a repository, aggregates a lookup table of user defined struct type definitions and their syntactic incarnation, and, through a drop down menu item exposes a means of removed nested layers of definitions in structs for visual impact.


The current state:

I wouldn't call this a beta. It's barely PoC material, and will be buggy if you try it out. It will be hard to use without familiarity with the bugs. In other words, it probably won't be useful until I've worked on it further.
