WIP

See https://medium.com/@nwcodex/abstraction-less-is-more-c70ae42fbafe for the theory behind this tool.

TODO - 

1. Improve struct definition identification (dentification is currenty limited to a few specific constructs associated with struct type definitions)
2. Add support for enums
3. Add support for classes


What it does:

Lintsc|cc|h|cpp files in a Git repository, generates a lookup table of user defined struct type definitions and their syntactic incarnation, and, through a drop down menu item exposes a means of removed nested layers of definitions in structs for visual analysis


The current state:

I would call this project an alpha state. It needs some firming up before it's ready for battle tested use. It's primary function is to illustrate my theory in https://medium.com/@nwcodex/abstraction-less-is-more-c70ae42fbafe. at the moment (:
